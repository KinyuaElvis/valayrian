## About Valayrian

Valayrian is a web application with expressive, simplistic features. I believe systems must be enjoyable and creative to be truly fulfilling. Valayrian takes the pain from farmers in a vertical environment(controlled environment) by detecting and eradicating whitefly infestations on cassava farms

Valayrian is easily accessible, and provides accurate results for provided analysis.
